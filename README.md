## Overview

- This is the java implementation of the `LZW Compression and Decompression` algorithm.

- I wrote this code to help me implement the algorithm in `VHDL` but I decided to post it as to help people who might have an intrest in algorithm understand it better or for people who need it to simply use it.

- To make it easier for people new to java, I wrote the methods in 2 seperate classes as `static` methods.

>I might add an implementation of the LZ77 algorithm sometime in the future. If you want me to prioritize it, message me.

## Technologies

- `JAVA SE 15`
---
## Setup

- Download the `Java SDK` from oracle or from your linux repository.
- Import the `Encoder` and the `Decoder` files into your project or simply clone this Repo.

## Usage

- Prepare the sequence to be Encodded by transforming it to a binary sequence. (do so however you wish!)
- Call the Classes' respective methods and utilize its effectiveness!
